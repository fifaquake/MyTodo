MyTodo
======
MyTodo is a **simple** online application of **GTD** system.

In order to run it, you need to

- Install [**Python3**](http://www.python.org/)
- Install **Node.js**
- Download the code

Then you need follow these steps:

1. Run StartMongod.py. In this step, this script will download MongoDB automatically.
2. Run StartApp.py.
3. Open your web browser and input [http://localhost](http://localhost)


This project is just used for myself to learn Node.JS, Javascript, HTML5, JQUERY, Git, MongoDB...and so on, so I cannot promise this will be a full product.
