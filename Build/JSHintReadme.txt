In current stage, I select the JSHint (http://www.jshint.com/) to ensure the quality of Javascript.

See "Platform" (http://www.jshint.com/platforms/) to get more information about how to use JSHint in differnt platform.

Now I use the JSLint for Visual Studio to do the quality check for javascript. And the JSHint.xml is the "Export file" from my VS2012.



!Note
I cannot find where I can set "onevar" option from the UI, so I just modified the JSHint.xml directly.
A good article for me to do this is from "http://ued.ctrip.com/blog/?p=2733#more-2733"
